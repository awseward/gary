# gary

A little home-rolled deployment thingamajig ðŸ¤·

Probably not anything to be taken all too seriously, at least currently.

## Configuration

Add a `.gary/` Directory in your project's root. Currently, includes:

##### `.gary/server`

Called to start web application server.

* Executable file (can be script or binary ðŸ¤·)
* Currently is not given any args, but that may change if deemed valuable

##### `.gary/on_deploy`

Called to do any necessary application setup (dependency install, datastore
migrations, etcâ€¦).

* Executable file (can be script or binary ðŸ¤·)
* Currently is not given any args, but that may change if deemed valuable

## Why the name?

Honest, not entirely sure. Felt right, I guessâ€¦
